# 🚀 clilog: Manage Your Tasks Right From the Terminal (CLI Log)

**clilog** is a simple, fast, and open-source Command Line Interface (CLI) utility, built 100% in **Bash**, designed to efficiently manage notes, reminders, and to-do lists without relying on complex external software or databases.

The primary goal of `clilog` is to provide a task management tool that is native to the Unix environment, offering **speed** and **minimalism**.

## 🛠️ Installation (Recommended Method)

Since `clilog` is designed to be a system-wide utility, installation uses global directories (`/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/lib`) and therefore **requires `sudo` privileges**.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/simeulinuxkaliaiwr/clilog.git
    cd clilog
    ```

2.  **Execute the Installer:**
    The `install.sh` script will copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin` and the logic module to `/usr/local/lib/clilog`.
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```

After installation, you can use the `clilog` command from any directory.

## 💾 Where Your Data Lives

Instead of cluttering your `$HOME` directory, `clilog` adheres to the **XDG Base Directory Specification** for data persistence.

Your notes are saved in a simple plaintext log file:

$$\mathbf{\$HOME/.config/clilog/notes.log}$$

This makes it easy to back up, manually inspect, and integrate with other command-line tools like `grep` and `cat`.

## ⚙️ Project Structure

`clilog` is split into two directories to ensure clarity and maintainability:

| Directory/File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`bin/clilog`** | The main router and executable. Handles argument validation and directs execution to the correct function. |
| **`src/functions.sh`** | Contains all the data manipulation logic (add, list, mark) using **`awk`** for secure file editing. |
| **`src/interactive.sh`** | Provides the interactive TUI mode using **`dialog`** for a more user-friendly terminal interface.
| **`install.sh`** | Script responsible for copying files to the global directories (`/usr/local/`). |
