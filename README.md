# üöÄ clilog: Manage Your Tasks Directly From the Terminal (CLI Log)

**clilog** is a fast, minimal, and open-source Command Line Interface (CLI) utility, built **in Bash And Python**, that allows you to efficiently manage notes, reminders, and to-do lists without relying on complex external software or databases.

**Clilog was made by a 13 year old Linux user!**

It‚Äôs designed to be a native Unix task management tool with a focus on **speed**, **simplicity**, and **minimalism**.

`clilog` is also available on the **AUR** as [`clilog-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/clilog-git/) for Arch Linux users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Recommended)

Since `clilog` is intended as a system-wide utility, it uses global directories (`/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/lib`) and therefore **requires `sudo` privileges**.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/simeulinuxkaliaiwr/clilog.git
cd clilog
```

2. **Run the Installer:**
The `install.sh` script copies the executable to `/usr/local/bin` and the logic module to `/usr/local/lib/clilog`.
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

After installation, `clilog` can be run from any directory.

Alternatively, Arch Linux users can install it via the **AUR**:
```bash
yay -S clilog-git
```

## üíæ Data Storage

`clilog` follows the **XDG Base Directory Specification**, keeping your `$HOME` directory clean.

Notes are saved in a simple plaintext log file:

```
$HOME/.config/clilog/notes.log
```

This allows for easy backups, manual inspection, and seamless integration with other command-line tools like `grep` and `cat`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

`clilog` is organized for clarity and maintainability:

| Directory/File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`bin/clilog`** | Main executable; validates arguments and routes commands. |
| **`src/functions.sh`** | Core logic for adding, listing, and modifying notes, using **`awk`** for safe file operations. |
| **`src/interactive.sh`** | TUI interactive mode using **`dialog`** for a user-friendly terminal interface. |
| **`src/clilog_web.py`** | WEB mode made with python |
| **`install.sh`** | Installs the files to global directories (`/usr/local/`). |
